I created a database for VendiCose SpA, a ficticious company that manages supermarkets, to handle the flow of orders for warehouses and their associated retail stores.

As part of this project I designed the database schema, including an ER diagram that outlines the entities, keys, and relationships. 

I then created the database using MySQL and wrote the necessary queries to manage the system. This included queries to update stock levels whenever a product is sold and queries to check the current inventory levels of any product across warehouses.
